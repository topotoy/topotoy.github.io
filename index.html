Our History
===================================================

We can proudly say that we have been at the forefront of physically-based rendering and GPU-acceleration for nearly two decades.

* ![ ](images/randomcontrol-history-maverick-studio.webp width="150")Maverick Excelsior. 2023. Maverick Studio is a GPU-accelerated render engine where our proprietary light simulation core is harnessed behind intuitive and interactive drag-and-drop tools. In Maverick you can import 3D models or CAD data and render impressive photo-real images with minimal effort. Maximizing the &quot;realism vs. user-effort&quot; trade-off is our vision.

* ![ ](images/randomcontrol-history-maverick-benchmark.webp width="150")Maverick Benchmark. 2020. Maverick Benchmark harnesses the Maverick Render core in a portable free tool that will tell you how performant your GPUs are. Our benchmark is a reliable stress-test for Nvidia CUDA GPUs as it involves most of the heavy-duty features supported by our engine such as full-GI path-tracing and physically-based material evaluation.

* ![ ](images/randomcontrol-history-maverick-indie.webp width="150")Maverick Indie. 2019. Maverick Indie (the baby brother of Maverick Studio) is an excellent rendering software to import models and materials from Substance Painter, Substance Designer, Zbrush, or Sketchfab and take amazing photo-real shots or render turntable presentations with the best quality and the least effort.

* ![ ](images/randomcontrol-history-double-down.webp width="150")Double-down. 2018. We were blessed by some business opportunities in 2017 that eventually led to the arrival of private investment to grow the team and double-down on our main areas of expertise: physically-based light simulation, image post-processing, and GPU-acceleration.

* ![ ](images/randomcontrol-history-arionfx.webp width="150")ArionFX. 2014. ArionFX is a set of tools for Lens Effects and HDR image post-processing that spawns from the tonemapping toolchain in Arion. ArionFX is distributed as a plug-in for all versions of Adobe Photoshop and After Effects. Some of the most remarkable features of ArionFX are physically-based Bloom & Glare, and advanced local/global Tone-Compression operators.

* ![ ](images/randomcontrol-history-arion.webp width="150")Arion. 2011. The success of fryrender led to the birth of Arion, which started as a port/rewrite of the fryrender core in Nvidia CUDA. Arion was one of the first GPU-accelerated render engines in the market. Over the years, most of the 3D industry has followed the same path.
<br>

* ![ ](images/randomcontrol-history-fryrender.webp width="150")fryrender. 2006. Fryrender was a pioneering product in the field of unbiased simulation of the physics of light. This approach to rendering, which meant a radical departure from classic rendering at the moment, has been widely embraced by the industry since then.
